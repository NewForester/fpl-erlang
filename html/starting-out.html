<h2 id="starting-out">Starting Out</h2>
<h3 id="the-shell">The Shell</h3>
<p>The Erlang shell can be used to test out most of your Erlang and it also lets you edit stuff live.</p>
<p>To start the shell from a Linux tty enter:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">    $ erl</code></pre>
<h3 id="shell-commands">Shell Commands</h3>
<p>The shell uses readline to provide emacs-style command line editing as does bash and other shell programs. However, its behaviour is more emacs-like than bash or Python and I may want to change the configuration.</p>
<p>It has auto-completion of names, type 'li', press tab and the shell till will probably complete this with 'lists'.</p>
<p>However, this is only name completion. You should complete a valid Erlang statement before pressing return.</p>
<p>Erlang statements needs a full stop (<code>.</code>) to terminate them. Thus</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang">    <span class="fu">help().</span></code></pre>
<p>will print information on some of the shell commands available.</p>
<p>To exit the shell, use one of:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang">    <span class="fu">q().</span>                <span class="co">% short for ...</span>
<span class="er">    init:stop().</span></code></pre>
<p>If the shell is unresponsive, it is time to break into job control with ^G. Typing 'h' in response to the prompt lists the option available, including interrupting the unresponsive shell. killing it, starting another shell or quitting Erlang.</p>
<p>Erlang statements may be separated with a comma (<code>,</code>). All are evaluated but, in the shell, only the result of the last one is printed.</p>
<p>The comma and full stop are a hang over from the days when Erlang was implemented in Prolog.</p>
