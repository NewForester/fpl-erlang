# Getting Started with Erlang User's Guide

The second [Erlang](http://erlang.org/doc/getting_started/users_guide.html) course I followed was also on the official Erlang site.
It was 5 modules and did take 4 days to complete.

The sections were:

 1. Introduction
 1. Sequential Programming
 1. Concurrent Programming
 1. Robustness
 1. Records and Macros

This course did cover the basics but since I took no notes of my own I did not learn much Erlang and the awareness I gained was soon lost.

There were exercises but these were more copy and paste examples.
I dutifully followed these and they can be found in the [Getting Started Examples](../tut-gs) subdirectory:

 * tut.erl through to tut13.erl (Sequential Programming)
 * tut14.erl through to tut18.erl (Concurrent Programming)
 * tut20.erl and tut21.erl (Robustness)

After tut21.erl, the rest of the tutorial was based on a longer example.
This seems to require Erlang installed and running on two co-operating machines
so I merely read through the text and derived very little benefit from it.

However, I believe I was mistaken and I could have run the co-operating processes on the same machine (from the same console).
So I have learnt something after all.
