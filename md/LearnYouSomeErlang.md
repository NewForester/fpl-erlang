# Learn You Some Erlang

This tutorial comes highly recommended.
It follows the style of the hugely popular Learn You A Haskell.

The tutorial is split into some three dozen sections.
This is in strong contrast with the first tutorial I attempted that had only five sections.

It may be that reading one a day would be comfortable but note taking and doing exercises will make it a stretch.
Unfortunately the evidence that the tutorial involved programming exercises was misleading:
there are only worked examples.

I intend to do the tutorial on-line at [Learn You Some Erlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com).
