Erlang Course: Notes

<h1 id="erlang-course">Erlang Course</h1>
<p>The first <a href="http://www.erlang.org/course/">Erlang</a> course I followed was on the official Erlang site. It was claimed the 5 module course contained exercises and would take 4 days to complete.</p>
<p>The modules were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>History</li>
<li>Sequential Programming</li>
<li>Concurrent Programming</li>
<li>Error Handling</li>
<li>Advanced Topics</li>
</ol>
<p>There were no exercises and the material seemed more like prompt sheets for a presentation about a course. I was not able to find a course with these modules on this site.</p>
<p>Reading this created an awareness that quickly faded.</p>
