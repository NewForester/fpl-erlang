Getting Started with Erlang: User's Guide

<h1 id="getting-started-with-erlang-users-guide">Getting Started with Erlang User's Guide</h1>
<p>The second <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/getting_started/users_guide.html">Erlang</a> course I followed was also on the official Erlang site. It was 5 modules and did take 4 days to complete.</p>
<p>The sections were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Sequential Programming</li>
<li>Concurrent Programming</li>
<li>Robustness</li>
<li>Records and Macros</li>
</ol>
<p>This course did cover the basics but since I took no notes of my own I did not learn much Erlang and the awareness I gained was soon lost.</p>
<p>There were exercises but these were more copy and paste examples. I dutifully followed these and they can be found in the <a href="../tut-gs">Getting Started Examples</a> subdirectory:</p>
<ul>
<li>tut.erl through to tut13.erl (Sequential Programming)</li>
<li>tut14.erl through to tut18.erl (Concurrent Programming)</li>
<li>tut20.erl and tut21.erl (Robustness)</li>
</ul>
<p>After tut21.erl, the rest of the tutorial was based on a longer example. This seems to require Erlang installed and running on two co-operating machines so I merely read through the text and derived very little benefit from it.</p>
<p>However, I believe I was mistaken and I could have run the co-operating processes on the same machine (from the same console). So I have learnt something after all.</p>
