Learn You Some Erlang Notes: Table of Contents

<h1 id="learn-you-some-erlang">Learn You Some Erlang</h1>
<p>This tutorial comes highly recommended. It follows the style of the hugely popular Learn You A Haskell.</p>
<p>The tutorial is split into some three dozen sections. This is in strong contrast with the first tutorial I attempted that had only five sections.</p>
<p>It may be that reading one a day would be comfortable but note taking and doing exercises will make it a stretch. Unfortunately the evidence that the tutorial involved programming exercises was misleading: there are only worked examples.</p>
<p>I intend to do the tutorial on-line at <a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com">Learn You Some Erlang</a>.</p>
