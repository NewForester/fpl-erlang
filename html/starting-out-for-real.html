Learn You Some Erlang Notes: Starting Out (for real)
</title>

<h1 id="learn-you-some-erlang">Learn You Some Erlang</h1>
<h2 id="starting-out-for-real">Starting Out For Real</h2>
<p>Erlang is a relatively small and simple language. It has, at least, that much in common with C.</p>
<p>There are a few basic data types. These are covered in this section.</p>
<p>The designers of the language deliberately did not provide proper character string handling but did see fit to provide some interesting bit sequence handling.</p>
<p>In common with other functional programming languages it has atoms, which have no direct equivalence in other languages.</p>
<h3 id="numbers">Numbers</h3>
<p>Erlang handles integer and floating point numbers.</p>
<p>Compound mathematical expression are supported: the 'normal' operator precedence rules apply.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+</code> - plus</li>
<li><code>-</code> - minus</li>
<li><code>*</code> - time</li>
<li><code>/</code> - divide</li>
<li><code>div</code> - integer division</li>
<li><code>rem</code> - integer remainder</li>
</ul>
<p>Plain integers are decimal. Number bases up to 16 are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>2#101010 - binary</li>
<li>8#0777 - octal</li>
<li>16#dead - hexadecimal</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="named-invariants-invariable-variables">Named invariants (Invariable Variables)</h3>
<p>In Erlang, 'variables' are <code>invariant</code>: once a value has been bound to a name, the value cannot be changed.</p>
<p>You bind a value to a name thus:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    One = 1.</span></code></pre>
<p>However, the <code>=</code> is actually a comparison operator (and the basis of Erlang pattern matching). It will raise an exception if the expression to the right and left do not evaluate to the same value.</p>
<p>If the expression on the left is an unbound name, the <code>=</code> operator will bind the right hand value to the name. Thus it is perfectly legal to appear to assign a value to a name more than once provided it is the same value.</p>
<p>Names to which a value may be bound ('variables') begin with an upper case letter.</p>
<p>They may also begin with an underscore (<code>_</code>) but, by convention, names beginning with an underscore are place-holders: they are used where a name must appear but where the value is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Just plain <code>_</code> is a special name. It may appear on the left of an assignment but Erlang will never bind a value to it. It use becomes apparent below.</p>
<p>It is possible to unbind a name so that a new value may be bound to it but only in the Erlang shell: not in production code. Use:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang">    <span class="fu">f(</span><span class="dt">Variable</span><span class="fu">)</span>         <span class="co">% unbind the name Variable</span>
    <span class="fu">f()</span>                 <span class="co">% unbind all names</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="atoms">Atoms</h3>
<p>In Erlang, an <code>atom</code> is a literal or, if you will, a constant with its own name for a value. About all you can do with atoms is pass them around and compare them.</p>
<p>A name that begins with a lower case letter is an atom (although there are a few that are 'reserved' words). When used this way they are a bit like anonymous enumerations in C.</p>
<p>Atoms may also be enclosed in single quotes (so atom = 'atom' compares true). The single quotes must be used when the atom contains spaces, does not begin with a lower case letter or contains characters other than the ASCII alphanumeric characters plus underscore (<code>_</code>) and at (<code>@</code>). When used this way they look a little like string constants but do not expect them to behave that way.</p>
<p>Atoms are used a lot in Erlang but not much on their own. They take up space but there is no garbage collection of atoms that have outlived their usefulness: use them modestly.</p>
<p>The following 30 atoms are reserved words in Erlang:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic operators - div, rem</li>
<li>Boolean operators - and, andalso, not, or, orelse, xor</li>
<li>Bit sequence operators - band, bnot, bor, bsl, bsr, bxor</li>
<li>Function conditionals - when, if ... end, case ... of ... end</li>
<li>Anonymous functions - fun ... end</li>
<li>Exceptions - try ... of ... catch ... after ... end</li>
<li>Message Passing - receive ... after ... end</li>
<li>others - begin, cond, let, query</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="boolean-algebra-and-comparison-operators">Boolean Algebra and Comparison Operators</h3>
<p>Two (standard) Erlang atoms are <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. They are atoms so they do not have values of 1 and 0 in the conventional sense but clearly they can be the result of expression such as comparisons.</p>
<p>Erlang has six Boolean operators: <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code> (which evaluate both their arguments), <code>andalso</code> and <code>orelse</code> (which do not evaluate their right hand argument if there is no need) and <code>not</code>.</p>
<p>There are two sets of equality operators:</p>
<ul>
<li>=:= and =/=, which compare type as well as the numeric value</li>
<li>== /=, which compare only the numeric value</li>
</ul>
<p>There are the four relational operators: &lt;, &gt;, &gt;=, =&lt; (beware this last).</p>
<p>Erlang does not do arbitrary type arithmetic but it will do arbitrary type comparisons. As I understand it, this allows generic, type-free, algorithms the same way that implementing operator== and operator&lt; does in C++.</p>
<p>The Erlang ordering is:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    number &lt; atom &lt; reference &lt; fun &lt; port &lt; pid &lt; tuple &lt; list &lt; bit string</span></code></pre>
<p>The ordering is not important but that the ordering is well defined is.</p>
<h3 id="tuples">Tuples</h3>
<p>In Erlang, a <code>tuple</code> is enclosed in <code>{}</code> (contrast with Python where they are enclosed in <code>()</code>). A tuple may comprise any number of elements of any type. Think of them as records of fields with no names.</p>
<p>The simplest tuple comprises two numeric values. X and Y co-ordinates perhaps.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    Point = {10,4}.</span></code></pre>
<p>Unlike other languages, access to values within a tuple is not by index but by pattern matching assignment:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    {X,Y} = Point.</span></code></pre>
<p>Assuming X and Y are unbound, this will bind the names X and Y to the two values of Point. Yes, there must be some clever scope rules that unbind variables automatically.</p>
<p>Erlang also permits:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    {X,_} = Point.</span></code></pre>
<p>which, in terms of assignment, ignores the second element of Point and only one name is bound.</p>
<p>In terms of pattern matching, it means match iff the first element of Point matches the value of X: we do not care what value the second element of point has.</p>
<p>One interesting use of tuples and atoms is to give ascribe units to values:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    Temperature = {celsius, 37.4}</span></code></pre>
<p>means 37.4 is a temperature on the Celsius scale.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    {fahrenheit, T} = Temperature</span>
<span class="er">    ** exception error: no match of right hand side value {celsius, 37.4}</span></code></pre>
<p>throws an error stopping the program incorrectly interpreting the temperature as if it were on the Fahrenheit scale.</p>
<p>A tuple like this whose first element is an atom is known as a <code>tagged tuple</code>.</p>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<p>In Erlang, a <code>list</code> is enclosed in <code>[]</code> (as they are in Python). They are the most useful data type in Erlang (as they are in other functional programming languages).</p>
<p>The elements of a list may be of any type so they are not really analogous to arrays.</p>
<p>There are two, right associative, operators for lists:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    1&gt; [1,2,3] ++ [4,5].</span>
<span class="er">    [1,2,3,4,5]</span>
<span class="er">    2&gt; [1,2,3,4,5] -- [1,2,3].</span>
<span class="er">    [4,5]</span></code></pre>
<p>The length of a list is returned by the eponymous BIF:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    3&gt; length([1,2,3] ++ [4,5]).</span>
    <span class="dv">5</span></code></pre>
<p>Note: Erlang has a number of Built In Functions (BIFs) that are not implemented in Erlang either because they cannot be or, rarely, for performance reasons. Nowadays, they are implemented in C.</p>
<p>The head of a list is the first element, the rest is the tail:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    4&gt; hd([1,2,3,4]).</span>
    <span class="dv">1</span>
<span class="er">    5&gt; tl([1,2,3,4]).</span>
<span class="er">    [2,3,4]</span></code></pre>
<p>The cons (<code>|</code>) operator (shades of Lisp here) is a very common list operator.</p>
<p>Add a value to a list before the head:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    6&gt; List = [2,3,4].</span>
<span class="er">    [2,3,4]</span>
<span class="er">    7&gt; NewList = [1|List].</span>
<span class="er">    [1,2,3,4]</span></code></pre>
<p>and to split a list into head and tail:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    5&gt; [Head|Tail] = NewList.</span>
<span class="er">    [1,2,3,4]</span>
<span class="er">    6&gt; Head.</span>
    <span class="dv">1</span>
<span class="er">    7&gt; Tail.</span>
<span class="er">    [2,3,4]</span></code></pre>
<p>A list is a recursive data structure comprising a head and a tail that comprises a head and a tail ...</p>
<p>At the end of a proper list is an empty list (<code>[]</code>). Erlang requires proper lists in all circumstances except pattern matching.</p>
<p>In pattern matching, Erlang will accept an improper list such as [Head|Tail]</p>
<h4 id="a-note-on-character-strings-...">A note on character strings ...</h4>
<p>Erlang does not implement a character string type.</p>
<p>A character string is, internally, a list of characters. So far so good but there are no special string operations.</p>
<p>Not so good is that a list of integers will be printed as a character string unless at least one of them cannot be represented by a character. This is tricky with Unicode.</p>
<p>However, there are other ways of representing strings.</p>
<h3 id="list-comprehensions">List Comprehensions</h3>
<p>In Erlang (and other functional programming languages) a <code>list comprehension</code> is an alternative to declaring a list by enumeration. They allow lists to be declared succinctly and so lead to powerful and, in some senses, clear code.</p>
<p>The Erlang syntax is derived from set notation.</p>
<p>The simplest form declares a list built from a <code>generator expression</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    1&gt; [2*N || N &lt;- [1,2,3,4]].</span>
<span class="er">    [2,4,6,8]</span></code></pre>
<p>Here N is a pattern that takes, in succession, the values of the list [1, 2, 3, 4].</p>
<p>The construction can be constrained to meet certain conditions:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    2&gt; [X || X &lt;- [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], X rem 2 =:= 0].</span>
<span class="er">    [2,4,6,8,10]</span></code></pre>
<p>Here the constraint means the result is a list of even integers.</p>
<p>There may be more than one constraint and more than one generator:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    3&gt; [X+Y || X &lt;- [1,2], Y &lt;- [2,3]].</span>
<span class="er">    [3,4,4,5]</span></code></pre>
<p>To illustrate the pattern matching aspect of the generator expression:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    6&gt; Weather = [{toronto, rain}, {montreal, storms}, {london, fog}, {paris, sun}, {boston, fog}, {vancouver, snow}].</span>
<span class="er">    [{toronto,rain},</span>
<span class="er">    {montreal,storms},</span>
<span class="er">    {london,fog},</span>
<span class="er">    {paris,sun},</span>
<span class="er">    {boston,fog},</span>
<span class="er">    {vancouver,snow}]</span>

<span class="er">    7&gt; FoggyPlaces = [X || {X, fog} &lt;- Weather].</span>
<span class="er">    [london,boston]</span></code></pre>
<p>This is more elegant than:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    8&gt; FoggyPlaces = [X || {X, W} &lt;- Weather, W =:= fog].</span>
<span class="er">    [london,boston]</span></code></pre>
<p>Contrast the <code>&lt;-</code> operator with <code>=</code>. With <code>&lt;-</code> no exception is thrown when 'not fog', as there would be with <code>=</code>. Also note there is some kind of rebinding going on here.</p>
<h3 id="bit-syntax">Bit Syntax</h3>
<p>Erlang is unusual in having a clean, simple, syntax for packing and unpacking bits. This is the telecoms origins showing through.</p>
<p>Bit syntax encloses binary data between <code>&lt;&lt;</code>and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> (here called a bit sequence) and splits it into readable segments separated by commas. By default, a segment is a sequence of bits on a byte boundary.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    1&gt; Colour = 16#F09A29.</span>
    <span class="dv">15768105</span>
<span class="er">    2&gt; Pixel = &lt;&lt;Colour:24&gt;&gt;.</span>
<span class="er">    &lt;&lt;240,154,41&gt;&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>An RGB colour is 24-bits, conveniently split into 3 byte values.</p>
<p>More interesting is using pattern matching to unpack binary content:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    3&gt; Pixels = &lt;&lt;213,45,132,64,76,32,76,0,0,234,32,15&gt;&gt;.</span>
<span class="er">    &lt;&lt;213,45,132,64,76,32,76,0,0,234,32,15&gt;&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>packs 12 byte values as a 12 x 8-bit sequence and:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    4&gt; &lt;&lt;Pix1:24, Pix2:24, Pix3:24, Pix4:24&gt;&gt; = Pixels.</span>
<span class="er">    &lt;&lt;213,45,132,64,76,32,76,0,0,234,32,15&gt;&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>unpacks it again using pattern matching into 4 x 24-bit values (Pix1, Pix2, Pix3 and Pix4).</p>
<p>It is possible to unpack one of the 24-bit pixel values to get just the first 8 bits:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    5&gt; &lt;&lt;R:8, Rest/binary&gt;&gt; = &lt;&lt;Pix1:24&gt;&gt;.</span>
<span class="er">    &lt;&lt;213,45,132&gt;&gt;</span>
<span class="er">    6&gt; R.</span>
    <span class="dv">213</span></code></pre>
<p>thanks to the flexibility of the syntax, which allows a binary segment to be given as one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Value</li>
<li>Value:Size</li>
<li>Value/TypeSpecifierList</li>
<li>Value:Size/TypeSpecifierList</li>
</ul>
<p>where Size is either bits or bytes depending on the Type in the type specifier list. In summary, the type specifier list may be built from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type - integer | float | binary | bytes | bitstring | bits | utf8 | utf16 | utf32</li>
<li>Signedness - signed | unsigned</li>
<li>Endianness - big | little | native</li>
<li>Unit - written unit:Integer</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    9&gt; &lt;&lt;16#C0A81300:4/integer-unsigned-big-unit:8&gt;&gt;.</span>
<span class="er">    &lt;&lt;192,168,19,0&gt;&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>Armed with this kind of syntax, parsing a TCP header is easy:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    10&gt; &lt;&lt;SourcePort:16, DestinationPort:16,</span>
<span class="er">        AckNumber:32,</span>
<span class="er">        DataOffset:4, _Reserved:4, Flags:8, WindowSize:16,</span>
<span class="er">        CheckSum: 16, UrgentPointer:16,</span>
<span class="er">        Payload/binary&gt;&gt; = SomeBinary.</span></code></pre>
<p>There are 6 BIFs for bit manipulation: <code>bsl</code> (Bit Shift Left), <code>bsr</code> (Bit Shift Right), <code>band</code>, <code>bor</code>, <code>bxor</code> and <code>bnot</code>.</p>
<p>Erlang also has <code>bitstrings</code> (yes, there seems to be some abiguity in the terminology). Storage-wise, these are much more efficient that lists:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang">    <span class="dv">11</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span> <span class="kw">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="st">&quot;this is a bit string!&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="fu">.</span>
    <span class="kw">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="st">&quot;this is a bit string!&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>Their downside is they are more difficult to use than lists (of characters). For that reason they tend to be used for string constants and the like.</p>
<p>Aside: Erlang is not a great language for heavy number crunching. It is much better suited to soft real-time applications that involve reacting to events and passing messages (that contain atoms).</p>
<h3 id="binary-comprehensions">Binary Comprehensions</h3>
<p>Erlang <code>binary comprehensions</code> are to bit sequences as <code>list comprehensions</code> are to lists.</p>
<p>In terms of syntax, <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> replace <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> and <code>&lt;=</code> replaces <code>&lt;-</code>:</p>
<p>Using a binary comprehension, line 4 from the previous section could be replaced with:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    1&gt; RGB = [ {R,G,B} || &lt;&lt;R:8,G:8,B:8&gt;&gt; &lt;= Pixels ].</span>
<span class="er">    [{213,45,132},{64,76,32},{76,0,0},{234,32,15}]</span></code></pre>
<p>which yields a list of RGB colours and will work with pixel bit sequences of arbitrary length.</p>
<p>The converse is:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    2&gt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;R:8, G:8, B:8&gt;&gt; || {R,G,B} &lt;- RGB &gt;&gt;.</span>
<span class="er">    &lt;&lt;213,45,132,64,76,32,76,0,0,234,32,15&gt;&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>which packs a list of RGB colours of arbitrary length into a bit sequence.</p>
<p>At the time the tutorial was written, binary comprehensions were relatlively new to the language and their use was not common. Therefore the tutorial does nothing more than introduce them.</p>
