<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="about-this-tutorial">About This Tutorial</h3>
<p>This tutorial is inspired by <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You A Haskell for Great Good</a>. It attempts to make the language attractive and the learning experience friendly.</p>
<p>It is aimed at people with a basic knowledge of programming who may or may not know functional programming.</p>
<p>It attempts to see Erlang for what it is (without hype) by acknowledging its weaknesses as well as lauding its strengths</p>
<h3 id="so-whats-erlang">So What's Erlang</h3>
<p>Erlang is a (real world) functional programming language: it seeks to respect referential transparency and data immutability as much as is pragmatically possible.</p>
<p>Erlang compiles to byte-code and so, like Java, requires a process virtual machine.</p>
<p>Erlang emphasises concurrency and high reliability through its use of the <code>actor</code> model. Here actors are separate processes with an Erlang virtual machine. Communication between actors is by means of <code>messages</code>: they share no other state.</p>
<p>Erlang comes with its own development environment comprising:</p>
<ul>
<li>compiler, debugger, profiler and test framework;</li>
<li>the Open Telecom Platform (OTP) Framework;</li>
<li>a web server and a parser generator;</li>
<li>the mnesia database, which is not like other databases;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Erlang virtual machine allows code to be updated in a running system without interrupting the program. Code can be distributed with ease and so Erlang scales nicely. Errors and faults can be managed in a simple but powerful manner.</p>
<p>The Erlang policy is &quot;let it crash&quot; since the Erlang run-time will recover in most cases.</p>
<h3 id="dont-drink-too-much-kool-aid">Don't drink too much Kool-Aid</h3>
<p>Erlang processes are light weight and this is good for scalability but this, in itself, means little: parallelism does not automatically make things faster and the additional overhead works to slow things down.</p>
<p>By the same token, Erlang cannot scale in direct proportion to the number of cores the processor has but it is better placed to take advantage of multi-core processors than other languages.</p>
<p>Erlang does some things well (robust, scalable web-servers for example) but does other things badly (image processing for example).</p>
<h3 id="what-you-need-to-dive-in">What you need to dive in</h3>
<p>You need to install the Erlang environment, that is all.</p>
<p>On many Linux distributions, this can be done by installing a binary package but the tutorial suggests, as expected, that this may install an out-of-date version and recommends installation from the latest source.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-get-help">Where to get help</h3>
<p>There are good man pages under Linux.</p>
<p>HTML documentation is available from the <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/">Official Erlang Web Site</a>.</p>
<p>There are good coding practices described <a href="http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Erlang community site, <a href="http://trapexit.org/">trapexit</a>, has a wiki and mailing lists presented as a forum.</p>
