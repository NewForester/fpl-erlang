# Erlang Course

The first [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/course/) course I followed was on the official Erlang site.
It was claimed the 5 module course contained exercises and would take 4 days to complete.

The modules were:

 1. History
 1. Sequential Programming
 1. Concurrent Programming
 1. Error Handling
 1. Advanced Topics

There were no exercises and the material seemed more like prompt sheets for a presentation about a course.
I was not able to find a course with these modules on this site.

Reading this created an awareness that quickly faded.
