<h3 id="reverse-polish-notation-calculator">Reverse Polish Notation Calculator</h3>
<p>Everyday arithmetic uses infix notation. Alternatives are prefix notation (aka Polish notation) and postfix notation (aka Reverse Polish Notation).</p>
<p>Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) was used in early calculators because it takes up little memory. Numbers are pushed onto a stack and operators consume pair of numbers and push a result.</p>
<p>This exercise is about building an RPN calculator in Erlang. Most of it is explained and little is left to the reader.</p>
<p>This is a little disappointing as I had hoped it was now my turn to write some Erlang. The description included a couple of bits from libraries that would have needed heavy hints otherwise.</p>
<p>An Erlang list can operate as a stack with the head being to top-of-stack.</p>
<p>First, how to parse and expression such as &quot;10 4 3 + 2 * -&quot; ?</p>
<pre class="sourceCode erlang"><code class="sourceCode erlang"><span class="er">    1&gt; string:tokens(&quot;10 4 3 + 2 * -&quot;, &quot; &quot;).</span>
    <span class="fu">[</span><span class="st">&quot;10&quot;</span><span class="fu">,</span><span class="st">&quot;4&quot;</span><span class="fu">,</span><span class="st">&quot;3&quot;</span><span class="fu">,</span><span class="st">&quot;+&quot;</span><span class="fu">,</span><span class="st">&quot;2&quot;</span><span class="fu">,</span><span class="st">&quot;*&quot;</span><span class="fu">,</span><span class="st">&quot;-&quot;</span><span class="fu">]</span></code></pre>
<p>I implemented the basic four functions, not the seven in the tutorial, and ignored the suggestion I add sum and prod functions. I tried to do this without looking at the answers first.</p>
<p>I added exception handling instead.</p>
<p>Erlangs view &quot;let it crash&quot; is fine if you are the programmer and you are going to fix the problem. Here we have a user facing calculator that will give very cryptic messages if there are too few or too many numbers or an operand is mistyped.</p>
<p>This exercise took a whole morning but since it was the first time I have tried to write Erlang without the answers in front of me, perhaps this was not too bad. Hard lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li>when you move statements around, you have to redo the full-stops, semi-colons and commas;</li>
<li>understand the error messages - particularly the run-time error messages;</li>
<li>if you are writing a function for <code>lists:fold/3</code> then you are not writing a recursive function;</li>
<li>catching exceptions: look at where they have come from.</li>
</ul>
